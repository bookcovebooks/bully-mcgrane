  "description": "In the hard-edged frontier town of Pistol Gap, life burns fast—worked hard, played harder, and ended without warning. When miner-turned-rider Tud Drury returns with a heavy stake and a plan to start clean, the town’s brutal marshal and a trio of dangerous men begin to close in. Drawn to the seamy glow of the Pride of the Hills and the promise of escape, Tud and the woman he won’t abandon must navigate a night where power writes the law and mercy is never guaranteed. A tense Western tale of redemption, devotion, and survival at the ragged edge of the hills.",
