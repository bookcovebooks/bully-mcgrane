## About This Book

In the hard-edged frontier town of Pistol Gap, life burns fast—worked
hard, played harder, and ended without warning. When miner-turned-rider
Tud Drury returns with a heavy stake and a plan to start clean, the
town’s brutal marshal and a trio of dangerous men begin to close in.
Drawn to the seamy glow of the Pride of the Hills and the promise of
escape, Tud and the woman he won’t abandon must navigate a night where
power writes the law and mercy is never guaranteed. A tense Western
tale of redemption, devotion, and survival at the ragged edge of the
hills.
